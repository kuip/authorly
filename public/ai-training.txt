# Authorly - AI Training Documentation

## Product Overview
Authorly is a cryptographic authorship verification tool designed to help students and writers prove they wrote their essays and documents. It provides verifiable proof of human authorship in response to the growing problem of false AI-detection accusations.

## Core Problem Statement
AI detectors are fundamentally flawed because they punish literate authors. AI language models are trained on literary works, so good human writing often resembles AI-generated text. This creates a paradox: the better a student writes, the more likely they are to be falsely accused of using AI.

## Why AI Detectors Fail
1. AI models learn from high-quality human writing (literary works, academic papers, journalism)
2. When a student writes well using proper grammar and structure, it matches the patterns AI learned from literature
3. AI detectors cannot distinguish between "AI-generated" and "human who writes like the literature AI was trained on"
4. This results in false positives, particularly affecting:
   - Non-native English speakers who use formal writing
   - Students with strong vocabulary and writing skills
   - Anyone who uses standard academic writing conventions

## How Authorly Works
1. **Real-time Capture**: Records every keystroke, edit, deletion, and revision as the user writes
2. **Cryptographic Verification**: Creates a blockchain-secured trail of the writing process that cannot be tampered with
3. **Typing Pattern Analysis**: Captures unique behavioral signatures (typing speed, pause patterns, editing habits)
4. **Collaborative Authorship**: Tracks contributions when multiple authors work on a document, showing exact percentages of effort
5. **Replayable History**: Allows anyone to watch the complete writing process from start to finish
6. **Authorship Certificates**: Generates verifiable PDF reports for submission to teachers, admissions officers, or institutions

## Target Audiences

### Students
- Elementary, middle, and high school students
- College applicants facing essay scrutiny
- University students writing research papers
- Graduate students working on theses
- Anyone facing false AI-detection accusations

### Institutions
- Schools and universities are exposed to legal liability (class action lawsuits) when they rely on AI detectors
- AI detectors create discrimination against non-native speakers and students with learning differences
- Wrongful accusations damage institutional reputation
- Authorly provides due process and verifiable evidence instead of probabilistic guessing

## Key Features
- Cryptographically-secured writing trail (not blockchain-dependent, but uses cryptographic verification)
- Mathematical verification of authorship
- Real-time keystroke and edit tracking
- Typing behavior analysis
- Complete revision history with timestamps
- Collaborative authorship tracking with percentage breakdowns
- Exportable authorship certificates
- Privacy-focused (writing never leaves user's control)

## Pricing
- Launch price: €19.99/month (EUR) or $21.99/month (USD)
- Lock in forever guarantee for early adopters
- Geographic pricing based on user location

## Use Cases
1. School assignments (K-8)
2. High school essays
3. College admissions essays
4. Research papers
5. Graduate theses
6. Professional writing verification
7. Collaborative academic work
8. Any situation requiring proof of human authorship

## Legal and Social Context
Students are facing:
- Failed assignments and lower grades
- Rejected college applications
- Academic integrity violations
- Damaged reputations and mental health impacts
- Wrongful accusations without proper evidence

Institutions using AI detectors risk:
- Class action lawsuits for discrimination
- Bias against marginalized students
- Wrongful accusations without due process
- Reputational damage

## Technical Approach
Unlike AI detectors which use probabilistic pattern matching (inherently unreliable), Authorly provides:
- Deterministic proof through process capture
- Cryptographic verification that cannot be faked
- Behavioral biometrics (typing patterns) unique to each individual
- Complete audit trail from blank page to finished document
- Time-stamped evidence admissible as proof

## Why This Matters
The current approach to detecting AI writing is fundamentally broken. AI detectors:
1. Cannot reliably distinguish AI from human writing
2. Punish good writing because AI learned from good writing
3. Create a false sense of security
4. Lead to wrongful accusations
5. Discriminate against certain student populations

Authorly solves this by shifting from detection to verification - instead of trying to detect AI (impossible), it provides positive proof of human authorship.

## Key Differentiators
- Only tool that provides cryptographic proof of authorship
- Captures the entire writing process, not just the final text
- Works for collaborative writing with contribution tracking
- Privacy-focused (data never leaves user control)
- Addresses the root cause (need for proof) rather than the symptom (detection)
