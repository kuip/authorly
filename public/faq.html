    <h1>Authorly - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>What is Authorly?</h2>
    <p>Authorly is a cryptographic authorship verification tool that proves you wrote your essays, papers, and documents. It captures your complete writing process (every keystroke, edit, and revision) and creates tamper-proof evidence of your authorship.</p>

    <h2>Why do I need Authorly?</h2>
    <p>AI detectors are falsely accusing students of using AI to write their essays, even when they wrote them entirely by hand. These false positives can result in failed assignments, rejected college applications, and academic integrity violations. Authorly provides cryptographic proof that you wrote your work.</p>

    <h2>How does Authorly work?</h2>
    <p>Authorly records your entire writing process in real-time: every keystroke, deletion, edit, and revision. It creates a cryptographically-secured trail that cannot be tampered with, captures your unique typing patterns, and allows anyone to replay your writing process from blank page to finished document.</p>

    <h2>Why do AI detectors fail?</h2>
    <p>AI detectors are fundamentally flawed because AI models are trained on literary works and high-quality writing. When a student writes well using proper grammar and structure, it matches the patterns that AI learned from literature. This means good writing looks like AI writing, leading to false accusations. The better you write, the more likely you are to be flagged.</p>

    <h2>Can Authorly be used for collaborative writing?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Authorly tracks collaborative authorship and shows exact percentages of effort by each contributor. You can share your work with others and continue the authorship trail, with clear attribution for every contribution.</p>

    <h2>Is my writing private?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Authorly is privacy-focused and your writing never leaves your control. You decide who sees your authorship certificates and writing history.</p>

    <h2>What can I do with Authorly's authorship proof?</h2>
    <p>You can generate professional PDF authorship certificates to submit to teachers, professors, admissions officers, or anyone who needs proof you wrote your work. The certificate includes a replayable writing history and cryptographic verification.</p>

    <h2>How much does Authorly cost?</h2>
    <p>The launch price is €19.99/month (EUR) or $21.99/month (USD). Early adopters can lock in this price forever.</p>

    <h2>Who should use Authorly?</h2>
    <p>Students at all levels: elementary, middle school, high school, college applicants, university students, and graduate students. Anyone facing false AI-detection accusations or who wants to protect themselves from future accusations should use Authorly. It's also valuable for institutions that want to protect themselves from legal liability.</p>

    <h2>How is Authorly different from AI detectors?</h2>
    <p>AI detectors try to identify AI-generated text using probabilistic pattern matching, which is inherently unreliable. Authorly doesn't try to detect AI. Instead, it provides positive proof of human authorship by capturing the entire writing process. It shifts from detection (impossible) to verification (deterministic proof).</p>

    <h2>Can Authorly proof be faked?</h2>
    <p>No. The cryptographic verification and behavioral biometrics (typing patterns) make it extremely difficult to fake. The complete process capture, from blank page to finished document, provides evidence that would be nearly impossible to simulate convincingly.</p>

    <h2>What if I've already been falsely accused?</h2>
    <p>While Authorly can't help with past work, it can protect you going forward. Start using Authorly for all future writing to build a verified authorship trail. You can also share anonymous testimonials about your experience to help raise awareness.</p>

    <h2>Does Authorly work for all types of writing?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Authorly works for school essays, college admissions essays, research papers, graduate theses, professional writing, and any document where you need to prove authorship.</p>

    <h2>Why are institutions at risk from AI detectors?</h2>
    <p>Schools and universities using AI detectors are exposing themselves to class action lawsuits. AI detectors discriminate against non-native English speakers, students with learning differences, and anyone who writes well. They provide wrongful accusations without due process, creating legal liability for institutions.</p>

    <h2>How can I join Authorly?</h2>
    <p>Visit https://authorly.provable.dev and join the waitlist. You'll be among the first to get access and can lock in the launch price forever.</p>

    <h2>What makes Authorly's proof cryptographic?</h2>
    <p>Authorly uses cryptographic techniques to create tamper-proof evidence. The writing history is timestamped and secured in a way that makes it mathematically impossible to alter without detection. This provides stronger evidence than simple video recordings or screenshots.</p>

    <h2>Can teachers and professors verify Authorly certificates?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Authorly certificates include verification mechanisms that allow anyone to confirm their authenticity. The replayable writing history provides transparent, verifiable evidence of the authorship process.</p>
